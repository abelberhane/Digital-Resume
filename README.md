# Digital-Resume

I have created an HTML Single Page website with standard CSS and responsive design. The text and theme is a Digital Resume and it was my first time really working with CSS.
There was a lot to take in and learn, my biggest take aways from this project would have to be utilizing the content-wrapping and working with paddings/margin.

I plan on implementing many more changes and updates, as a list of improvements kept growing the more I coded. This was a great dive into Web Development and I will be
working with JavaScript shortly. 

Here are some screenshots of my work. Please feel free to give your recommendations, comments, or tips. Cheers.
