                <!-- Add as many paragraphs as I need. -->
                <p>I received my 4 year degree from the University of Phoenix in Computer Science. The subject matter was very rewarding and required that I utilized the internet and stack overflow extensively without the aide of face to face teaching. The material covered ranged from Relational Databases to Developing for iOS with Swift. I am thankful for my experiences and the time spent with the University of Phoenix.</p>

                <p>My time at the University of Central Florida allowed me to truly discover my passion in Computer Science. Being able to apply for Graduation in Medicine, but knowing your heart was really in technology was eye opening and I have not been able to look back. I could not imagine what it would be like to be able to wake up and develop everyday, and thats when I applied to the University of Phoenix and began working full time to make it happen.</p>
